## Broadcasting Message To All Clients Within A Channel

The broadcast method permits users to send a message to other members within its channel. The user will not see its own message.

### Client Side

```ts lineNumbers=true 

// example below demonstrates 'user is typing...'
document.getElementById('messageInputBox').addEventListener('onChange', () => {
  const user = document.getELementbyId('user').value;
  const message = `${user} is typing`;
  sono.broadcast(message);
});

```
