## When should you invoke sono.connect?

First thing you will need to do is set up your server with your own specified port. Once you have this set up you'll want to create a new instance of the Websocket API on the client side with a url passed in. For example 'ws://localhost:<your port number>/ws'

Remember that if necessary, you can change colors and include a default
dark theme. To do so, check this [doc](/usage/shadowing#changing-theme-colors).
